# Chess NFT Dynamic Valuation Platform

## Overview

Transforming Chess into a Digital Asset Economy, our platform redefines the classic game by integrating blockchain-powered NFTs with a performance-based valuation system. Every chess piece is an NFT whose value evolves dynamically based on the quality of your moves, measured by a sophisticated algorithm underpinned by game theory and advanced mathematics.

This isn’t about luck—it’s a pure game of skill where every move counts. Players build real digital wealth by demonstrating strategic mastery, and the system rewards only truly brilliant play.

## MVP & USP

- **MVP:**  
  - A fully functional chess platform with traditional gameplay.
  - NFT minting for every chess piece.
  - A dynamic valuation system that updates piece values in real time based on in-game performance.
  - Batch update mechanism for efficient NFT value adjustments.

- **USP:**  
  - **Performance-Based NFTs:** Each piece’s value updates dynamically based on your move quality.
  - **Skill-Driven Rewards:** Our proprietary algorithm quantifies each move—rewarding smart, strategic play and discounting poor decisions.
  - **New Revenue Model:** Monetize your chess skills by boosting your NFT portfolio; capture or upgrade pieces based on your in-game performance.

## Business Proposal

Our platform merges competitive chess with blockchain technology, creating a transformative revenue stream for players:
- **Monetization:** Skilled play directly translates to increased NFT values, which can be traded or leveraged for bonuses.
- **Fair Play:** This is a game of skill—not chance—ensuring rewards are earned solely through superior strategy.
- **Market Opportunity:** With the rapid growth of eSports and digital collectibles, our solution opens new avenues for monetizing intellectual and strategic talent.

## Real-Life Importance

- **Empowering Players:** Turn your chess skills into real digital assets.
- **Transformative Experience:** Participate in a system where every move adds tangible value.
- **Future of eSports:** Redefine competitive gaming with blockchain transparency and innovative monetization.

## How It Works

### Dynamic Valuation Engine

1. **Move Analysis:**  
   - Each move is evaluated using advanced chess engines (like Stockfish) and our in-house game theory model.
   - We compute an evaluation score (**S**) for the move, adjusted by a utility factor (**U**) that considers both the player’s and opponent’s ratings.
   - A time factor (**T<sub>move</sub>**) rewards quick, decisive moves.
   - The current store value (**W<sub>piece</sub>**) of the piece scales the impact.

2. **Delta Calculation:**  
   The change in the piece’s value for the move is computed as:
   \[
   \Delta = S \times \frac{U_{player}}{U_{opponent}} \times T_{move} \times W_{piece}
   \]
   Positive Δ indicates a good move that boosts the piece’s value, while negative Δ represents a poor move that diminishes it.

3. **Cumulative Performance (G):**  
   We maintain a running sum:
   \[
   G = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Delta_i
   \]
   Only moves that improve your overall performance (i.e., where \(G > 0\)) count toward triggering bonuses.

4. **Dynamic Threshold (T):**  
   A rating- and game-length–adjusted threshold is defined as:
   \[
   T = B \times \left(1 + \frac{R_{player} - R_{base}}{K_T}\right) \times \frac{N_{expected}}{N_{actual} + \varepsilon}
   \]
   - **\(B\):** Base threshold constant.
   - **\(R_{player}\) & \(R_{base}\):** Player’s rating and baseline rating.
   - **\(K_T\):** Scaling constant.
   - **\(N_{expected}\) & \(N_{actual}\):** Expected total moves vs. moves played.
   - **\(\varepsilon\):** A small constant for stability.

5. **Bonus Mechanism:**  
   When the performance index \(P = \max(G, 0)\) drops below \(T\) (i.e., the player performs exceptionally well), a bonus margin:
   \[
   M = T - P
   \]
   is unlocked. This margin allows the player either to add that value to a chosen piece or to capture an opponent’s piece with a corresponding store value.

### Skill vs. Luck

Our system is entirely **skill-based**:
- **Skill-Driven:** Every move is meticulously evaluated through our advanced algorithms. Success is determined by strategy, precision, and quick decision-making.
- **No Gambling:** Unlike platforms where chance dictates outcomes, here your digital asset growth is exclusively tied to your chess performance.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Web-based chess interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express server handling game logic and valuation algorithms.
- **Chess Engine:** Integration with Stockfish for real-time move evaluation.
- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts (Ethereum or similar) for NFT minting and batch updates.
- **Math & Game Theory:** Proprietary models ensure that only superior, well-calculated moves increase NFT values.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm
- Access to a blockchain environment (e.g., Ethereum testnet/mainnet)
- Stockfish installed on your system

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-nft-platform.git
   cd chess-nft-platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   Create a `.env` file with necessary variables (e.g., PORT, blockchain RPC endpoint).

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on the configured port (default is 3000).
