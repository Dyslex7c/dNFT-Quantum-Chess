## Overview

Beyond Checkmate transforms traditional chess into a dynamic value-creation system by tokenizing chess pieces as NFTs with values that update based on move quality. The platform rewards strategic excellence and skilled gameplay through a mathematically sound economic model, creating new opportunities for chess players to earn based on their abilities.

## Features

- **SFT-Backed Chess Pieces**: Each chess piece is a unique SFT with dynamic valuation
- **Real-time Value Updates**: Piece values change based on move quality and strategic importance
- **Skill-Based Rewards**: Players earn through demonstrated strategic excellence
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration**: Secure player verification without compromising privacy
- **Blockchain Integration**: Transparent marketplace and secure value tracking

## System Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components:

1. **Chess Gameplay Engine**
   - Web-based interface
   - Real-time move evaluation
   - Integration with Stockfish engine

2. **Dynamic Valuation Model**
   - Real-time position evaluation
   - Game theory-based value updates
   - Performance tracking metrics

3. **Blockchain Layer**
   - SFT minting and management
   - Smart contract integration
   - Marketplace functionality

## Mathematical Model

### Move Valuation

The value change (∆) for each move is calculated using:

```
∆ = S × (Uplayer/Uopponent) × Tmove × Wpiece
```

Where:
- `S`: Evaluation score of the move
- `Uplayer/Uopponent`: Utility ratio based on player ratings
- `Tmove`: Time factor rewarding efficient play
- `Wpiece`: Current store value of the SFT piece

### Dynamic Threshold

The bonus trigger threshold is calculated as:

```
T = B × (1 + (Rplayer - Rbase)/KT) × (Nexpected/Nactual + ε)
```

## Technical Implementation

### SFT Architecture

Each chess piece SFT includes:

**Static Properties**:
- Piece type
- Visual characteristics
- Historical significance

**Dynamic Properties**:
- Current position
- Movement history
- Performance metrics

### Zero-Knowledge Proof System

The platform implements zk-SNARKs using:
- secp256k1 elliptic curve
- Polynomial encoding of game history
- Quadratic Arithmetic Programs (QAP)

## Security Features

- Perfect Completeness in zero-knowledge proofs
- Computational Soundness based on q-SDH and DLP hardness
- Statistical zero-knowledge with 2^(-λ) security parameter
- Multi-exponentiation optimization for performance
- Batched verification for multiple proofs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Next.js (v14 or higher)
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
